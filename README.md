# Repository Creation and Dataset Initialization

## Description
This repository was created to collaborate on managing a dataset using Data Version Control (DVC). The dataset has been initialized and added to DVC for versioning and tracking changes. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Instructions for Creating the Repository
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_URL>`
3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory: `cd <repository_name>`
4. Initialize DVC: `dvc init`
5. Add the dataset to DVC: `dvc add <path_to_dataset>`
6. Commit the changes: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Add dataset"`
7. Link the repository to a remote storage location: `dvc remote add origin <remote_storage_URL>`
8. Push the dataset to remote storage: `dvc push`

# Repository Cloning and Dataset Retrieval
